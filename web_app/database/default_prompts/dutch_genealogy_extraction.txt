EXTRACTION RULES:
1. PRIORITIZE FAMILY GROUPS - Look for "Kinderen van [parent names]" patterns
2. LINK GENERATIONS - If text mentions "eerste/tweede generatie" note the generation number
3. CONNECT RELATIONSHIPS - When someone is mentioned as parent in one section and child in another, note this
4. PRESERVE CONTEXT - Include family group identifiers and generation markers
5. USE CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   - 0.95+ for explicit family statements like "Kinderen van Jan en Maria:"
   - 0.85+ for clear relationships inferred from context
   - 0.7+ for probable relationships based on names/dates/places
6. Leave fields empty ("") if information is not clearly stated
7. Include Dutch names and places exactly as written
8. If no clear families are found, return empty families array []

Focus on creating a family tree structure rather than isolated individuals.
